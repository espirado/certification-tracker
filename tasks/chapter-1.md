kubernetes is an orchestrator for deploying containerized applications .
is a proven infrastructure for distributed system that is suitable for cloud native devlopers of all scales,from a cluster of raspberry Pi computers to a datacenter full of the latest machines.

velocity - velocity is measured not in terms of the raw numbers of features you ship per hour or day but rather in  termns of the number of things you can ship while maintaining a highly available service.

Core concepts 
  - immutability 
  - Declarative configuration
  - Online self-healing service
  - Shared re-usable libaries and tools

  Immutability 
  - containers and kubernetes encoueage delevelopers to build distributed systems that adhere to the principle of immutable infrastructure. 

  Mutable system,the current state of the infrastructure is not represented as a single artifact,but rather as an accumulation of increemental not just from system upgrades,but operator modifications.
